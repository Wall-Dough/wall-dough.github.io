To pass the time they dig into a crushing lemonation on Top Chef and the much-anticipated ascent of Padma Lakshmi to the role of Head Judge. They also recall their intense reaction to seeing a helicopter on The Bachelor and respond to the show's claim that the amount of love you can have for someone isn't affected by how many hands you have.

Ultimately, ERIN GIBSON is on the scene to figure out what her favorite reality show would be if she watched any, and also to play a game related to the new Real World cast.</description>
